            <p>Since its inception in October 2014, Team TIBURON has been bagging laurels through its unwavering hard work and determination. After bagging the 1st Runners Up in SAUVC-18, Team TIBURON emerged as the WINNER in SAVe-2019. As a
              prerequisite, the team went through three rounds of qualification namely a Preliminary Design submission, a Conceptual Design Report submission, and an oral presentation round. A team of 16 students led by Shailesh Chandra Prusty
              visited IIT Madras for the final competition held between 23-24 January.

                The event consisted of two rounds. The team breezed through the first round, where the top 5 teams were shortlisted for the Finals. In the second round, the AUV completed all but one task and was adjudged joint winners with IIT
                Bombay. SAVe-2019 was a relatively new experience for this team as all the members who took part in SAVe-2017 had graduated.</span>

            It is not every day that you get an opportunity to represent an institute of national importance on a cosmopolitan stage. Team TIBURON made it possible in 2019, as it qualified for Robosub 2019, held in San Diego, California, United
            States. The competition demands the participating AUVs to perform a set of challenging pre-defined tasks spanning over multiple rounds. Broadening up its area of expertise, Team TIBURON proved its mettle on the international stage by
            reaching the semifinals in its very first appearance in Robosub.

            <p>Team TIBURON participated in SAUVC-18, organized by IEEE OES Singapore and Singapore Polytechnic from 9th March to 12th March. The SAUVC-18 competition challenges student teams to build an AUV which can perform a set of pre-defined
              tasks based on AUV navigation, visual identification, acoustic localization, and robotic manipulation. Team TIBURON's AUV, HAMMERHEAD completed the first two tasks and emerged as the 1st runners-up in the competition. Moreover, it
              became the first Indian team to secure a position in the top three teams among all the 46 teams from the 13 countries.</p>

            <p>Team TIBURON got national acclaim for the first time at SAVe-2017(Student Underwater Vehicle) as it was adjudged as the second runners up. Despite the misfortune of Cyclone Vardah leading to landfall on the day of the competition, the
              teams were able to stay motivated and worked hard during power cuts to work for a postponed competition date. A new venue was chosen, which had many differences from the mentioned arena specifications. Hence last moment changes were
              needed in hardware and software to compensate for this. The team's AUV for the competition, TIBURON 2.0 boasted of having minimum weight and lowest manufacturing cost amongst all the participating AUVs.</p>

                <p>SAVe 2019 was a very new experience for all the members of the team as only the graduated members of the team had been a part of the previous instance of the competition. The preparation for the competition had started from April
                  last year. We chose to go for the task consisting of shooting torpedo as the Cupid's visibility was better than the bins underwater. Winning has kept our morale high by motivating us to acheive greater heights but failure has taught
                  us an important lesson to overcome the limitations of our vehicle for further challenges.</p>

                  in future. Also, the team was ready to face other such challenges.
                  The journey of RoboSub-2019 taught us many lessons in terms of team management and development of vehicles. The journey was excellent and the vehicle’s performance was awesome. I’m sure if we would get another opportunity to attend

              <blockquote>
                <p>Despite the misfortune of Cyclone Vardah making landfall on the day of the competition, the teams were able to stay motivated and worked hard in the midst of power cuts to work for a postponed competition date.</p>
                <p>The competition was done at a new venue, which had many differences from the mentioned arena specifications, last moment changes were needed in hardware and software to compensate for this.</p>
                <p>It was an enriching experience competing and taking advice with other teams.</p>
